I was privileged to present about Logic Apps at the [Azure Sydney User Group](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Azure-Sydney-User-Group/events/259970627/).

The slide deck is available at [https://github.com/wicksipedia/presentations](https://github.com/wicksipedia/presentations).

[Microsoft Reactor](https://twitter.com/msftreactor) was a great space and I think all had a good time last night.

The Demo Gods definitely played havoc with the demos - there’s a demo in the presentation that I had based off the next day’s weather:

- if over 30 send an email to wear shorts
- if under 20 send a reminder email to bring a jumper
- if forecasting rain send a reminder email to bring an umbrella

Unfortunately, Sydney decided to have pleasant weather…

Thankfully we finished off with a high note - a Logic App posting the selfie tweet for the night.
