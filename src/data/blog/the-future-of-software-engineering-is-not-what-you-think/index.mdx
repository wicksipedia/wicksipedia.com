I was scrolling LinkedIn and the usual things were flying along my screen, then I saw a post about the future of software engineering and the role AI will play in our industry.

## The LinkedIn Post

## My Thoughts

The "RIP SWEs" talk has been a thing for a while, and I think it misconstrues what software engineering is really about. Yes, AI tools are becoming more powerful and can write some good code but software engineering has never been just about writing code.

IMHO AI is not going to make software engineering automatable, it’s going to make the industry double down on the fundamentals that we already know are critical: documentation, clean coding practices, patterns, and most importantly testing.

### What Software Engineering Really Is

Software engineering is about:

- **Understanding problems** - AI can suggest solutions, but understanding the actual problem space requires deep domain knowledge and human insight
- **Making architectural decisions** - Choosing the right architecture, patterns, and trade-offs requires experience, judgment, and ownership of the decision
- **Communicating with stakeholders** - Translating business needs into technical requirements and vice versa
- **Maintaining and evolving systems** - The majority of software engineering work is maintaining existing systems, not writing greenfield code

### AI as a Tool, Not a Replacement

I see AI tools like Claude, Copilot, and others as powerful multipliers for software engineers, not replacements. They can:

- Speed up routine coding tasks
- Help explore unfamiliar APIs and libraries
- Assist with boilerplate and repetitive code
- Provide quick references and documentation

But they still require a skilled engineer to:
- Validate the output
- Integrate it into the larger system
- Ensure it meets quality standards
- Adapt it to the specific context

Saying that it has a near zero marginal cost is very superficial. It ignores the significant hidden costs of software development, namely maintainability, security, and domain knowledge. AI doesn’t solve these, in fact for AI to be effective, you still need a clean codebase, rigorous documentation, and comprehensive testing.

The developer’s role hasn’t changed fundamentally, you still need an architect to understand the system, rationalize trade-offs, and identify novel improvements.

AI’s effect on software engineering is history repeating:

- Mathematicians and the calculator
- Accountants and spreadsheets (VisiCalc)
- Architects and AutoCAD

Since this isn’t a new thing to happen, it has been studied. Gemini 3 Flash summed it up for me:

> In economics, the [Jevons Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) states that as a tool makes a resource more efficient (and thus cheaper), the demand for that resource actually increases rather than decreases. Spreadsheets made accounting cheaper, so companies hired more accountants to do deeper analysis

Just as spreadsheets led to more complex financial analysis rather than fewer accountants, AI will likely lead to more software being built, increasing the demand for developers who can effectively direct these systems.

### The Shifting Skill Set: "Slowing Down to Go Fast"

Rather than replacing engineers, I think AI will shift the skill set toward critical evaluation. Since AI is inherently sycophantic, it will confidently agree with a bad idea just to please the user. This means you now have the ability to ruin things much faster than before.

More than ever, there is a need to "slow down to go fast." Engineers must think deeply about the architecture and validate the output before letting the AI start sprinting.

This shifts the core skills we need to focus on:

1. **Higher-level thinking** - More time on architecture and design, less on syntax
2. **Domain expertise** - Understanding the problem domain becomes even more critical
3. **AI collaboration** - Learning to effectively use AI tools as part of our workflow
4. **Human Connection** - Being able to interact deeply with domain experts and stakeholders is more important than ever
5. **Critical evaluation** - Being able to quickly assess and validate AI-generated code

### My Take? "Ship to learn" & the "build vs buy" shift

I think this AI era will trigger the decline of many "commodity" SaaS products.

Historically, we had to spend ages manually validating business models and "prototyping" before writing a single line of code because the cost of building the wrong thing was too high. AI flips that math because we can now ship functional software so rapidly, the code itself becomes the validation tool. We can learn if a business model works by actually putting it in front of users in a fraction of the time. Literally “ship to learn”.

This also changes the “build vs buy" equation. We used to use off the shelf SaaS because of the “last mile”. Those niche, custom features that made a product awesome to use but too expensive to try to replicate. Now, AI handles the 80% boilerplate and makes that “last mile” more affordable. When a user needs a specific, bespoke feature, we can offload that to AI agents.

We are moving into an era where companies will choose to build highly bespoke systems tailored exactly to their operations rather than settling for fragmented subscriptions. Not all platforms are affected, platforms like Xero will remain essential due to their high stakes domain (compliance and tax law).

I don’t believe that we will necessarily see shorter lead times overall... Instead, we’ll use that time to deliver a 100% fit-for-purpose product that has been validated by real-world use.

### What This Means for Junior Engineers

It's scary to think that there are people out there that think that we don't need junior engineers. Though understandably, there is a legitimate concern about how junior engineers will develop their skills when AI can generate much of the code. I think this means:

- Mentorship becomes more important than ever
- Focus shifts to understanding concepts rather than memorizing syntax
- Junior engineers need to learn to think critically about code, not just write it
- Pair programming with both humans and AI becomes a key learning tool
- Communication is a core technical skill - describing a problem clearly, whether to another dev, a client, or an AI agent is now half the job. Juniors can no longer "hide" behind code, they must articulate their reasoning.

## Conclusion

The software engineering profession isn't dying, rather it's evolving. Just as we evolved from punch cards to high level languages, from waterfall to agile, we're now evolving to work alongside AI. The engineers who thrive will be those who embrace these tools while continuing to develop the uniquely human skills that make great software engineers.

What are your thoughts? Are you concerned about AI's impact on software engineering, or excited about the possibilities?
